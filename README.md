# ur tru image

I led a small team in developing this site for multidisciplinary music and arts collective “Ur Tru Image” and worked as the primary liaison between the team, designer and client.

I developed the application using React, TypeScript, and GraphQL,  testing in React Testing Suite, Jest  and Cypress and deploying through AWS. I also made the decision to migrate the app to Next.js so that I could leverage the optimized performance and SEO benefits that it offers.
